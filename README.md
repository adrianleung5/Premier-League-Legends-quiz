### Initial Concept
To gain ideas for the general design of the quiz i gathered inspiration from fellow students in code insitutes project that was obtained from the peer review channel on slack. An example of a site i took inspiration from would be [Sean Johnstons quiz] (https://github.com/seanf316/P2-Movie-Buff-Or-Bluff)

### Wireframes
The Wireframes were produced using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). 
The final site varies from the wireframes due to developments that occurred during the building process. 

### Colour Scheme
The color scheme used on this website was based on the hero image. [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) was used to identify the colours associated with the hero imahge. This identified a selction of 5 colours. The quiz is predominantly based on only of these colours Russian Violet. The color white was chosen to provide a nice contrast to the site and was used as the main colour for the text of the site. Ultraviolet was as the box shadow effect around the buttons of the site.
